# noir

**noir** is an experimental micro-engine built around one idea:
take an input, strip it down to its essentials, and return something sharp, minimal, and high-contrast.

no noise. no extras. just a single, focused transformation.

---

## features

* **single-purpose core** — one function that does one thing extremely well
* **predictable output** — deterministic, stable behavior
* **zero dependencies** — lightweight and portable
* **clean api** — designed to be readable at a glance

---

## install

```bash
npm install noir
```

or

```bash
pip install noir
```

(use whichever applies to your actual project)

---

## usage

```js
import noir from "noir";

const result = noir(input);
// do something with the output
```

---

## roadmap

* optional plugins for extended transformations
* improved error handling
* performance tuning
